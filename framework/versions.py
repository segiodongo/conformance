"""Decide whether a test's rules apply to the version a server implements.

Demo only. A server advertises the release each of its capabilities
implements, such as `2026-04-08`. The catalog records which releases state
each rule (see `framework.requirements`). Before a `spec_assert` test runs,
the rules it cites are compared with the version the server advertises for
their capability: if that version states none of them, the test doesn't
apply. It is skipped with a reason that starts with `NOT_APPLICABLE_PREFIX`,
which `framework.outcomes` records as its own outcome, one that never counts
against the server.

A version newer than every release the catalog knows is taken to implement
the catalog's own version, the draft, and so is a server that advertises no
version. A version between two releases is taken to implement the older one.
